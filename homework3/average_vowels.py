# File: average_vowels.py

# You’re curious about the average number of vowels compared to consonants in a paragraph.

# --- 1. Counting Vowels ---
# Write a return function that takes a string as input.
# The function should return a tuple containing:
#     (number of vowels, number of consonants)
# Name this function: counting_vowels_and_consonants()

# Hint: You can use .isalpha() to check if a character is a letter.

def counting_vowels_and_consonants(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"

        if str.isalpha():  # only count letters
            if str in vowels:
                num_vowels += 1
            else:
                num_consonants += 1

    return (num_vowels, num_consonants)

# --- 2. Average Vowels ---
# Write a return function that takes in a paragraph (string) as input.
# The function should:
#   - Split the paragraph into individual sentences.
#   - Use counting_vowels_and_consonants() to count values for each sentence.
#   - Return a tuple: (number of sentences, average vowels per sentence, average consonants per sentence)
# Name this function: average_vowels_and_consonants()
